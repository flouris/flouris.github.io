<h4>Researcher in Computer Systems.</h4>
<p><strong><a href="http://michail.flouris.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/MFlouris-Brief-Resume-Latest-Sep2015.pdf" target="_self">[Brief CV]</a></strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my personal page!</p>
<p>I’m a researcher in Computer Science (PhD in Systems) with 10+ years of experience in engineering high-performance systems. I&#8217;m also a hacker with a curious mind, an entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for technology and science. I care a lot about the design of a sustainable environment for a future society with less inequality and more happiness.</p>
<p>My contributions in the area of computer systems include 25+ peer-reviewed publications in conferences, journals and books, as well as strong participation in several research projects, conferences and dozens of paper reviews for major conferences and journals.</p>
<p>Since early 2012, I&#8217;m working as a Core Engineer in the <a href="http://onapp.com/storage/" target="_new">Storage Platform Group</a> of <a href="http://onapp.com" target="_new">OnApp</a>, a UK-based company developing cloud software for hosts. My job involves engineering storage software components in the Linux kernel, as well as buidling and testing user-space distributed I/O stacks (block and file layers).</p>
<p>In parallel, I&#8217;m also working as a Researcher in the same group. We are currently involved in research for emerging, power-efficient micro-server architectures (as part of the <a href="http://www.euroserver-project.eu" target="_new">Euroserver FP7-funded R&#038;D project</a>), focusing more specifically on the topics of (i) scalable network and storage I/O, and (ii) energy-driven resource management in cloud architectures. </p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ph.D.</strong>: Computer Science, University of Toronto, Canada.</li>
<li><strong>M.Sc. &amp; B.Sc.</strong>: Computer Science &amp; Mathematics, University of Crete, Greece.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Research Interests</h4>
<p>My research interests lie in the wider areas of computer systems, scalable data storage, parallel/distributed/cloud computing, high-performance networks, embedded systems, computer architecture, and web application performance.</p>
<p>My recent research activities are focused on <strong>performance, scalability, reliability and management issues in direct-attached and distributed storage systems</strong>. The topic of my Ph.D. thesis is <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1807/17759" target="_new">&#8220;Extensible Networked-Storage Virtualization with Metadata Management at the Block Level&#8221;</a>. Past research experience in the areas of Grid computing, Distributed systems, Security, Web Caching and Network RAM.<br />
